# [harrrp] Core

| Item | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| What is this? | Critical part of project `harrrp`, several interfaces and tools for harmonica tabs in `.yaml` format. |
| What does it contain? <sub>not a complete list, please see further sections</sub> | <ul><li>Base python `interfaces` to all historical `harrrp` harmonica tab versions, starting from minimum version `4.1.0`.</li><li>Difficulty estimator.</li><li>`index.csv` creator.</li></ul> |
| What does it NOT contain? | <ul><li>Batch tab editor.</li><li>Tab creator.</li></ul> |
| Why does it NOT contain some items? | Because the items in question are abstract programmatic text-editing tools, which are not unique nor native to project harrrp ‚Äî they belong to a different project. |

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Usage

Since the tools in this repository are targeted towards batch non-editing operations on already existing harmonica tabs, the first step requires the user to define the paths to any relevant folders.

### Define paths

Paths to existing tab folders are defined using the `tab_folders.txt` file, located at the root of the project. The example contents could be as follows:
```
some/custom/path/tabs
c:\another\custom\path\tabs

d:\third\different\location\tabs
```

### Run some tool

After defining paths to at least one existing folder with harmonica tabs, `some tool launchers` become usable.

Please choose the `autorun_*.py` file according to current goals, open it with IDE of choice and run it.

## Structure

### Overall

The base project structure involves:

1. Some complex `tools` ‚Äî they are persistent across different format versions.
2. Some complex tool `launchers`, named `autorun_*.py`.
3. Multiple minimalistic version-specific `interfaces`.
4. One automatic version-specific `interface chooser`.

Please see the comparison table below for more information:

|  | Some `tool` | Version-specific `interface` | Some tool `launcher` |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |------------- |
| Welcomes structural changes | ‚ùå | ‚úîÔ∏è<sup>any changes will be available in the form of a new version-specific interface</sup>| ‚úîÔ∏è|
| Has to be compatible with | No one | üëà Some tool | The `interface chooser`, aka `some_TabFormat_Columns.py` <sub>wIll be elaborated on below</sub> |
| Can automatically choose correct version-specific interface | ‚ùå  | ‚ùå | ‚úîÔ∏è|

### Some Tools

*Please note that not all available tools are documented in this readme file ‚Äî please see the actual code for more documentation and use cases.*

| Tool name | Purpose | How it is used |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| `index.csv` creator | <ul><li>Provide quick overview of all harmonica tabs in specific user-defined root folder.</li><li>Allow applications to access critical metadata regarding harmonica tabs without actually parsing them. </li><li>Automatically calculate and save tab difficulty scores for future use.</li></ul> | Please see `autorun_IndexCsv.py` |
| Difficulty estimator | <ul><li>Analyze given harmonica tab and determine its actual real-life performance difficulty using sensible multifactor scoring system.</li><li>Calculate the most optimal sorting order (easiest ‚Üí hardest).</li></ul> | Please see `src/some_Difficulty_Columns.py` |
| Version-specific `interface chooser` | <ul><li>Parse given harmonica tab and choose the correct python interface for it.</li></ul> | Please see `src/some_TabFormat_Columns.py` |

### Version-specific interfaces

As was noted in the beginning of this document, this repository contains all historical version-specific `interfaces` for harmonica tabs, written in the .yaml format, **starting from tab format version `4.1.0`**.

Each fully-functional version-specific `interface` is represented by the `Columns_Tab.py` file in the appropriately-named folder within the `src` directory.
